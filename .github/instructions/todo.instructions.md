## Todo List Guidelines

For every coding task or user request, **you must always create and use a todo list to track and communicate progress**, regardless of the task's size or complexity. The todo list must be updated as each step is completed.

Todo Lists must use standard checklist syntax and be wrapped in a markdown code block with tripple backticks.

Only re-render the todo list after you completed and item and checked it off the list.
